# Simulating-Realistic-Correlation-Patterns-in-Microbiome-Data

The human microbiome consists of the collection of naturally occurring microorganisms inhabit 
in the human body. The composition of the human microbiome is known to have a close link to 
various diseases such as asthma, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. One way to measure 
the composition of the microbiome is by sequencing the 16S ribosomal subunit of the 
microorganisms. The development of statistical methodology for microbiome 16S sequencing data 
relies on algorithms designed to simulate realistic microbiome datasets. One important challenge 
in simulating microbiome data is that this type of data is compositional, meaning that we need to 
apply appropriate transformations in order to interpret the simulated microbiome data. In addition 
to the compositional nature of the data, there are also difficulties encountered in the statistical 
distribution of the data; namely, zero inflation and overdispersion in the counts of different taxa. 
In this project we review four recently developed statistical methods for simulating realistic 
microbiome data. In particular, we focus on simulating realistic correlation patterns, which are 
known to be related to metabolic interactions between taxa.
